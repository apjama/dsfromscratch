# Data Science from Scratch 

This is my first serious look at data science. I bought an Oâ€™Reilly book called Data Science From Scratch. These are the code snippets from the book and some additional notes to myself. 


I plan to add more notes to this, and as I learn more about this subject to continue to come back to it, and make my notes more insightful/useful.
